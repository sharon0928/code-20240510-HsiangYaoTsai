## Automated approaches streamline repetitive tasks and ensure consistency across datasets. 
### Key automated steps include:
##### 1.	Data Type Configuration: Automatically defining data types for each column to ensure uniformity and prevent errors.
##### 2.	Filtering Information: Setting up automated filters to exclude irrelevant data and focus on pertinent information.
##### 3.	Column Management: Automating the deletion of unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset.
##### 4.	Outlier Detection: Implementing automated restrictions and rules to identify and handle outliers.
##### 5.	Data Transformation: Converting categorical variables into dummy variables for analytical purposes through automated processes.
## Manual Tasks - Despite automation, certain tasks require manual intervention to ensure data integrity:
##### 1.	Exception Handling: Identifying and rectifying anomalies or nonsensical data entries that automation might miss.
##### 2.	Initial Data Review: Manually inspecting the dataset upon receipt to catch and correct human errors. For example:
###### •	In the *“contract_type”* column, correcting entries like “wide area” to the appropriate type.
###### •	In the *“second_place_outcome”* column, ensuring that entries reflect the correct status (e.g., changing incorrect 'win' entries to 'lost').
##### 3.	Frequent Error Correction: Regularly checking and correcting common errors, such as those in the date columns.
## Long-term Improvement and Roadmap
### To enhance the process long-term, the following steps should be taken to standardize workflows and minimize human error:
##### 1.	Structured Database Creation:
###### •	Develop a database with well-defined structures to enforce data format consistency and reduce manual corrections.
##### 2.	Building a Data Layer:
###### •	Establish a layered data approach, from raw data to clean data and then to machine learning (ML) pipeline data. This enables:
###### •	Basic analysis using clean data.
###### •	Preparation for ML models using pipeline data.
###### •	Verification and correction of inconsistencies by referring back to raw data.
##### 3.	Visualization Implementation:
###### •	Use visualization tools to monitor and identify pattern changes in the dataset. Significant pattern shifts in raw data should prompt a re-evaluation of the ML model to maintain accuracy.
##### 4.	Model Reassessment:
###### •	Regularly validate the prediction model’s accuracy. If the model fails to reflect results accurately, investigate potential missing variables, gather additional data, and update the model accordingly.
## Scaling the Process
### To scale the process from handling a few SKUs to managing hundreds or thousands, focus on reducing manual effort and enhancing automation:
##### 1.	Enhanced Automation:
###### •	Expand the use of automation to cover more aspects of data processing and cleaning, thus minimizing manual intervention.
##### 2.	Scalable Infrastructure:
###### •	Invest in robust data infrastructure capable of handling large volumes of data efficiently.
##### 3.	Advanced Monitoring:
###### •	Implement advanced monitoring by applying dashboards and alerting systems to detect anomalies and deviations at scale.
##### 4.	Continuous Improvement:
###### •	Foster a culture of continuous improvement, regularly updating processes and tools to handle increasing data volumes and complexity.

#### By implementing these strategies, the process will become more efficient, scalable, and resilient to human errors, ensuring high-quality data management and analysis.
